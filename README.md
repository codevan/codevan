Insights gained in the art of data

We're in Alvin Toffler's 3rd wave in data, and no longer need to live with commonly accepted levels of delay, mistake, defective material and defective workmanship (Demming). 

## Philosopy
Get -> manipulate -> gain insights -> take action

1. Code: On time, to standard, without waste
1. Data: Extract, Clean, Conform, Deliver
1. Science: Automated actionable insights

## Currently playing with:
1. Scala's breeze.linalg._ linear algebra library
1. Python's numpy library - also linear algebra

Hopefully in time, this will be a great place to find lots of data science insights and code.
Right now, I've got years of code, scripts and snippets which need a smarter home, and ideas that need to be shared.
